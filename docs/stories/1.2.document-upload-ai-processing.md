# Story 1.2: Document Upload and AI Processing

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** professional user,
**I want** to upload documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT) and get AI-powered summaries and insights,
**so that** I can quickly extract key information from large documents without manual reading.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can upload documents via drag-and-drop or browse interface (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT up to 50MB)
2. Document processing status tracking (in progress, completed, ready)
3. AI-powered document analysis with summarization, insight extraction, and action item identification
4. Existing authentication system controls document access and ownership
5. New functionality follows existing oRPC API pattern for type-safe file upload and processing
6. Integration with existing AI SDK infrastructure maintains current performance standards
7. Document upload and processing covered by appropriate tests including file validation and AI analysis
8. File upload UI follows existing Shadcn-ui component patterns with proper error handling
9. No regression in existing AI summarization or authentication functionality verified

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
**Location**: E2E tests in `tests/e2e/`, unit tests co-located with source files
**Framework**: Playwright for E2E testing, Bun test runner for unit tests
**Standards**: [Source: architecture.md#Testing Architecture]
- Test file upload scenarios including large files and edge cases
- Mock file processing to avoid dependencies on external services
- Test AI integration endpoints with sample documents
- Verify proper error handling for unsupported file types

### Architecture Context

**Technology Stack**: [Source: architecture.md#Technology Stack]
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, oRPC (1.8.6), Drizzle ORM (0.44.2), SQLite with LibSQL
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.0 with App Router, TanStack Query (5.85.5), Shadcn-ui, Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: Vercel AI SDK (5.0.39) with Google AI SDK
- **File Processing**: Node.js built-in modules, appropriate text extraction libraries

**Project Structure**: [Source: architecture.md#Project Structure]
- **Database Schemas**: `apps/server/src/db/schema/`
- **API Routers**: `apps/server/src/routers/`
- **Frontend Components**: `apps/web/src/components/documents/`
- **File Storage**: Secure directory structure for uploaded files

**Database Architecture**: [Source: architecture.md#Database Architecture]
- Existing user table in `apps/server/src/db/schema/auth.ts`
- Foreign key relationships with auth.user table required
- File metadata storage with processing status tracking
- Proper indexing for user-based document queries

**API Architecture (oRPC)**: [Source: architecture.md#API Architecture]
- **Server Side**: Context-aware procedures with authentication middleware
- **Client Side**: TanStack Query integration for file upload progress
- Type-safe error handling for file operations
- Multipart form data handling for large file uploads

**AI Integration**: [Source: architecture.md#AI Integration]
- Existing Vercel AI SDK integration patterns
- Google AI SDK for document analysis
- Consistent error handling and response formatting
- Integration with existing AI processing infrastructure

**Security Considerations**: [Source: architecture.md#Security Considerations]
- File type validation to prevent malicious uploads
- Secure file storage with proper access controls
- User-based access restrictions for document management
- Input sanitization for extracted text content

### File Locations
- **Documents Schema**: `apps/server/src/db/schema/documents.ts`
- **Documents Router**: `apps/server/src/routers/documents.ts`
- **Upload Components**: `apps/web/src/components/documents/upload/`
- **Document Management**: `apps/web/src/components/documents/management/`
- **Document Pages**: `apps/web/src/app/documents/`
- **E2E Tests**: `tests/e2e/documents.spec.ts`

### Technical Constraints
- 50MB file size limit as specified in PRD
- Support for PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT formats only
- Must integrate with existing authentication and AI systems
- Follow oRPC patterns for all API communications
- Maintain Ultracite code quality and accessibility standards

### Dependencies
- Requires Story 1.1 (Manual Notes) to be completed for AI integration patterns
- Builds on existing authentication and database infrastructure
- Uses established AI SDK configuration and patterns
