### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** Top-level horizontal navigation with Dashboard, Notes, Documents, Voice Notes, and Search as main sections. Account/settings accessible via user avatar dropdown.

**Secondary Navigation:** Context-sensitive sidebars within each section:
- Notes: Tags, folders, recent notes
- Documents: File types, processing status, folders
- Voice Notes: Recording history, transcription status
- Search: Filters, saved searches, search history

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Hierarchical breadcrumbs for folder navigation and content organization. Format: Section > Folder > Subfolder > Content Item. Search results show: Search > Query > Results.

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Quick Note Creation with AI Summary

**User Goal:** Capture thoughts quickly and get AI insights without losing momentum

**Entry Points:** Dashboard quick action, global "+" button, keyboard shortcut

**Success Criteria:** Note created, content captured, AI summary generated, user continues workflow

#### Flow Diagram

    H --> I[AI generates summary]
    I --> J[Summary displayed in sidebar]
    J --> F[Auto-save note]
    F --> K[User continues or exits]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:

- AI service unavailable: Show offline mode, queue for later processing
- Network interruption: Local storage backup, sync when reconnected
- Empty or very short content: Suggest minimum content length for effective summarization
- AI processing timeout: Allow manual retry, provide alternative manual tools

**Notes:** This flow prioritizes speed and non-interruption. AI features are additive, not blocking.

### Flow 2: Document Upload and Processing

**User Goal:** Extract insights from existing documents without manual reading

**Entry Points:** Dashboard upload area, drag-and-drop anywhere, documents section

**Success Criteria:** Document uploaded, text extracted, AI analysis complete, insights accessible

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User selects/drags file] --> B[File validation]

    G --> H[Real-time processing updates]
    H --> I[Analysis complete notification]
    I --> J[Document viewer with insights panel]
    J --> K[User reviews/interacts with insights]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:

- Unsupported file format: Clear error with supported format list
- File too large: Compression options or chunked upload
- Corrupted file: Error detection with retry option
- OCR failure: Manual text input option
- AI analysis failure: Provide basic text extraction as fallback

**Notes:** Processing transparency is crucial - users need to understand wait times and status.

## Wireframes & Mockups

**Primary Design Files:** Figma workspace with component library foundation based on Shadcn-ui patterns

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

**Purposeful Motion:** Every animation serves a functional purpose - providing feedback, guiding attention, or maintaining spatial relationships. Avoid decorative animations that don't enhance usability.

**Respectful Timing:** Animations respect user time and attention. Quick feedback (100-200ms), moderate transitions (200-400ms), complex state changes (400-600ms). Always provide motion reduction options.

**AI-Aware Animation:** Processing animations should feel intelligent and purposeful, not mechanical. Use organic easing curves and variable timing to suggest AI "thinking" rather than simple computation.

### Key Animations

- **AI Processing Pulse:** Subtle breathing animation for AI action buttons during processing (Duration: 2000ms, Easing: ease-in-out, infinite loop)
- **Content Appearance:** Smooth fade-in with slight upward movement for AI-generated content (Duration: 300ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1))
- **Status Transitions:** Color and icon transitions for processing states (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Panel Expansion:** AI sidebar slides in with content fade-in (Duration: 400ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94))
- **Search Results:** Staggered appearance of search results (Duration: 150ms per item, Easing: ease-out, 50ms delay between items)
- **Upload Progress:** Smooth progress bar with anticipatory easing (Duration: Variable, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1))
- **Error States:** Gentle shake for form errors, fade-in for error messages (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Success Confirmation:** Brief scale animation for successful actions (Duration: 200ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55))

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Initial app load under 2 seconds on 3G, dashboard ready in under 1 second on cable/wifi
- **Interaction Response:** UI feedback within 100ms for all user actions, even during AI processing
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations, graceful degradation to 30fps on lower-end devices

### Design Strategies

**Progressive Loading:** Design interfaces that work well with incremental content loading. Show content structure first, then populate with data. AI-generated content appears in dedicated, clearly marked areas that don't shift existing layout.

**Optimistic UI Patterns:** Design interactions that provide immediate feedback even when AI processing takes time. Show expected content areas immediately, populate when ready. Use skeleton screens for predictable content layouts.

**Graceful Degradation:** Design core workflows to function without AI features when services are unavailable. AI enhancements should feel additive, not essential for basic functionality.

**Intelligent Caching:** Design content displays that work well with cached AI results. Show when content is AI-generated vs. user-created. Indicate when AI analysis is fresh vs. cached.

**Chunked Processing:** Design file upload interfaces that communicate progress clearly for large documents. Show incremental results as text extraction and AI analysis proceed.

**Background Operations:** Design notification systems for AI operations that can complete while users work on other tasks. Provide clear status and results when operations complete.
